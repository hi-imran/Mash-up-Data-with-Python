# Mash-up-Data-with-Python
Hey! World this project will take you through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. The TasteDive API lets you provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.). If you are reading till now it means you already liked this project. So pull this code in your local repo and do some awesome stuff and let me know.
